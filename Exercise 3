A simple way to store variables (values) in your program is to use variables. Variables are placeholders that can store values, like strings (words), numbers (int) etc.  
 
To create a variable, just give it a name and an initial value, for example for a number:  
number = 7 
or for a String (words):  
myword = “This is my word” 
 
5) Write a program that asks the user for his/her name and produces an output like:  
 
Hi there, what is your name? 
>User input to be read< 
Hello  
“User name” 
How are you?
