1) Write an algorithm that describes how to make scrambled eggs, try to use control words, like IF, WHEN, UNTIL, WHILE, WAIT, AND, OR.  
 
2) Is Idle (the Python language shell) an Interpreter or an Compiler or both? Explain your answer.  
 
3) Write a command in the Idle shell that says “Hello world” 
 
4) Write a program that produces the following output:  
Hello World 
I am in my ISD class right now 
 
Reminder on “Input”: 
 
A simple way to store variables (values) in your program is to use variables. Variables are placeholders that can store values, like strings (words), numbers (int) etc.  
 
To create a variable, just give it a name and an initial value, for example for a number:  
number = 7 
or for a String (words):  
myword = “This is my word” 
 
5) Write a program that asks the user for his/her name and produces an output like:  
 
Hi there, what is your name? 
>User input to be read< 
Hello  
“User name” 
How are you?
